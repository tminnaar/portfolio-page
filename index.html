								retail and begin a lifelong career as a developer.

							I'm excited by the diversity of work and multitudes of opportunity in the field and feel like web development is the perfect stepping stone into
							the industry. I'm drawn the problem-solving nature of coding and the creativity, both visually in design and within the nuts and bolts of

							Using .addEventListener, .querySelector and .classlist.add for the first time, I created a function that changes the class of the element between
							2 styles as well as swapping the button textarea between "+Expand" and "-Collapse".

							</strong>
							<br />
							Using today.get I declared values for the day, month and year. Then using DOM Manipulation and expressions for each value I pushed the string into
							each paragraph element. Media queries were used to then alter the display at descending screen width intervals to reduce the number of cards on
							the screen and their widths and alter the font sizing of the headings.

								submit, comments are displayed below and persist when a new comment is added.
							</strong>
							<br />
							Using a Form Element I created inputs within for Name and Email Address and a textarea for the comment. I learnt about focus and active and used
							stylings to highlight which input was currently active. Using DOM Manipulation the saved comments are added below using .appendChild. I also
							learnt about alerts and utilised them to alert the user if the character limited has been exceeded when trying to submit.

								either side. The user can add or edit their own review which is then stored within the key for each film and is persistent when navigating and
								sorting.
							</strong>
							<br />
							Objects! Using Object.keys.sort I mutated the movie data object to return an array of the keys to establish an index, which could then be used to
							sort alphabetically and navigate between cards. This allowed me to manipulate text and image elements when navigating or sorting. Learning about
							.setAttribute allowed me to push image source links from object property values into the element as well as alter the background-colour in the
							body. dataset.mode allowed me to create 2 different states for editing or displaying the reviews and window.confirm helped solved the unexpected
							issue reviews being saved when navigating or sorting in edit mode.

								targets randomly resize and reposition. The panel on the right displays the time remaining, current score and high score which are updated using

								removes the target and allows the user to start again.

								image, description and learnings. I went for a monochromatic color scheme, a sleek background image and animations on hover and on page load.
							</strong>
							<br />
							I used pseudo classes more frequently here in order to achieve fill and underline animations on the tabs and keyframe animations to animate the
							header underline on page load. Within my navigation function I used Array.from to index all the tabs to iterate through and add or remove classes
							to toggle the display state. <br />
							I managed to include my Reflex Game within the website with some minor CSS changes to account for clashes in sizings and header stylings.
